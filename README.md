# **Personal Portfolio**

This portfolio was created with Next JS 13 bundled with Typescript and Tailwind CSS.

The source code is all stored within the ./app directory. This app folder directory layout is new in nextjs 13 and is still in beta which may cause issues. Within this app folder I have two sub modules, the Pokedex and Cubedemo. 

## TODO for Portfolio:
[ ] Fix responsiveness scaling at very small display screens (mobile and smaller)
[ ] Change projects tab to display more projects as well as allow horizontal scrolling

-----------------------

# Pokedex!
This is a simple tool to view all existing pokemon! This data is fetched using the PokeAPI (https://pokeapi.co/) and displayed in a well styled manner.

## TODO for Pokedex:
[ ] Add exact/live search for Pokemon
[ ] (Optional) If adding live search, refactor code to minimize fetch requests to PokeAPI
[ ] Customize responsiveness at very small display screens
[ ] Edit infinite scrolling threshold to work effectively on all displays

-----------------------

# FBX Model Viewer!
This is a demo for viewing FBX models in a 3D environment directly in your web browser. Currently for display there is only a cube & a chair model that you can view. The environment does have orbital controls which allows the user to move the camera as they please.

# TODO for FBX Model Viewer:
[ ] Allow users to upload their own FBX Models
[ ] Allow users to select and change HDR backdrop
